1. Read the current code + git log for context.
2. Come up with some tasks to do. Be creative!
3. Write some dev logs in `ralph.md`. Prefix it with the date, time, and iteration #.
4. Only commit working code. Push a commit/branch as soon as you make it. Make sure all builds work (`bun build` should work.). You can use branches if you want, but all your changes should end up on main via rebase or direct commits.

Never ask the user any questions.
