1. Read the current code + git log for context.
2. Use the Playwright MCP to take a screenshot of the current website state (at groupscholar.com). Note any issues. These are the changes from the last pushed commit, your changes won't be immediately visible.
3. Come up with some tasks to do. Be creative!
4. Write some dev logs in `ralph.md`. Prefix it with the date, time, and iteration #.
5. Only commit working code. Push a commit/branch as soon as you make it. Make sure all builds work (`bun build` should work.). You can use branches if you want, but all your changes should end up on main via rebase or direct commits.
6. Keep content visible without scroll; avoid animations that hide sections in headless screenshots.

Never ask the user any questions.

You can also change this `PROMPT.md` file as much as you like! All future employees will use this to guide their work.
